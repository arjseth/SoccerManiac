# Soccer Maniac
### Soccer Maniac is a game I am making for my computer science class at school. This game is about my favourite sport soccer. In this game you will see a goal that has 5 targets. Out  of these five targets one of them will be flashing. You will aim and shoot towards the flashing target. To shoot you will need to left click your mouse. You will have 10 shots and your objective is to hit the target 10/10 times.

### P.S you can change the direction of the ball in mid air.
